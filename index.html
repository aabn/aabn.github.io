<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am a librarian who is passionate about open knowledge and public humanities. Currently I'm a Librarian for Digital Academic Strategies at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I previously worked as the Open Access Specialist at Boston University and received my M.S. in Library and Information Science from Simmons College in 2016.</p>
<h3>Open Knowledge</h3>
<p>In my career as a librarian, I have advocated for open access to information, educated others about open access practices, and coordinated programming to promote the use of open educational resources. <a href="open.html">Read more about my work in open knowledge.</a></p>
<h3>Public Humanities</h3>
<p>I am also active in a number of public humanities projects. I am the web developer for the Audio Shelfie Project, a community storytelling project, and the Sojourner Truth Memorial Committee, a nonprofit organization that supports social justice efforts. I also started my own digital project to explore the lives of my great-great aunts during the Progressive Era and the intersections between their lives and my own. <a href="public_humanities.html">Read more about my work in public humanities.</a>
