<h2>Audio Shelfie Project</h2>
<p>I am the web developer for the <a href="httsp://www.audioshelfie.com">Audio Shelfie Project</a>, a digital storytelling project that gives readers a space to tell stories about the roles books play in their lives. We pose questions about reading and collect stories from participants in communities we visit, as well as on our site. Each story is paired with a photo of the storyteller to create an “audio shelfie.” Together, these audio shelfies form libraries of readers’ experiences with books. We work with our partners to create listening guides that can themselves help inspire further community conversations on a wide range of issues.</p>
<h2>Sojourner Truth Memorial Committee</h2>
<p>I am the web developer and social media coordinator for the Sojourner Truth Memorial Committee, a nonprofit organization that honors Sojourner Truth's legacy through scholarships to high school students active in social justice and educational programming on abolition, women's rights, and local history. As part of a Mass Humanities grant, I coordinated the production and promotion of an <a href="https://www.historypin.org/en/the-african-american-heritage-trail/">online walking tour promoting the African American Heritage Trail</a>.</p>
<h2>The Newman Aunts</h2>
<p>The Newman Aunts project studies the lives of six sisters who came of age during the Progressive Era, through the stories that have been preserved in the collective memory of one family. <a href="http://www.newman-aunts.com">Visit the site.</a></p>
