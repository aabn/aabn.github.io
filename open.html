<h1>Open Knowledge</h1>

<p>I'm an advocate for open access, open education, and all forms of open knowledge.</p>
<h2>SPARC Open Education Leadership Program</h2>
<p>I am a member of the <a href="https://sparcopen.org/people/anna-newman/">2018-19 cohort of the SPARC Open Education Leadership Program</a>. Through this program, I will be connecting with other open education advocates and developing an open education initiative at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.</p>
<h2>Open Access Policy Compliance</h2>
<p>While the Open Access Specialist in the Boston University Libraries, I was responsible for implementing the university's open access policy for faculty publications. I coordinated the Libraries' efforts to implement the researcher information management system Symplectic Elements, in collaboration with the Provost's Office and Information Systems & Technology, to integrate open access policy compliance with the faculty annual review process.</p>
<h2>Outreach & Education</h2>
<p>I have organized many outreach events and programming to encourage open scholarship, including Open Access Week, OpenCon Boston 2016, an Open Meetup series, and open textbook workshops. Among the events I coordinated were a series of transcribe-a-thons to engage the Boston University campus community in crowdsourced transcription projects. In a <a href="http://www.bu.edu/disc/2017/12/07/transcribe-a-thons-and-open-access/">blog post</a>, I discuss the process for organizing a transcribe-a-thon for a Boston University collection of recipe cards and how these events can introduce open access to a community. </p>
<p>To educate undergraduates about open access, I developed a presentation called <a href="https://doi.org/10.31229/osf.io/fbhds">"What Beyonce Can Teach Us About Open Access,"</a> which uses Beyonce's album "Lemonade" as an example to explain the concept of open access. By framing "Lemonade" as an information resource, I expore modes of and barriers to access and encourage participants to discuss questions of privilege, power, and equity in relation to access to information.</p>
<h2>Digital Collections</h2>
<p>I have worked for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Boston Public Library, and the American Archive of Public Broadcasting to create metadata records for collections that are made openly available in digital repositories.</p>
